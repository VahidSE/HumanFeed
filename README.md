🧠 HumanFeed
The first text-based social media platform without algorithms or data collection. Built with .NET 8 Core MVC and jQuery AJAX, under the banner of LessHungryApps.

🌱 Vision
HumanFeed exists to reconnect people through raw, unfiltered conversations. No feeds tailored by algorithms. No data harvesting. Just human expression—in words.

We believe emotional resonance deserves space in tech, not noise.

🚀 Tech Stack
Backend: ASP.NET Core 8 MVC

Frontend: Razor Views + jQuery AJAX

Database: SQLite (starter), Azure SQL (scaling)

Deployment: Azure App Service

🔒 Guiding Principles
No algorithmic manipulation of content

No user data collection beyond login necessities

All content is text—no media distractions

Every user is unique by GUID, not by tracked behavior

Anonymity is respected, but moderation is built-in

🗂️ Core Features (MVP)
Custom Login: Username + GUID-based identification

Text Posts: Shared publicly or in VibeRooms

VibeRooms: Themed or anonymous spaces for focused conversation

Cards: One-on-one messaging with emotional brevity

Reports: User-driven moderation without surveillance

🔁 Refresh Logic
AJAX calls manage updates using light polling:

New posts, cards, and vibe activity

Minimal server load

Optimized for cost efficiency and clarity

📦 Roadmap
Multilingual support (no auto-translate)

Threaded conversations and ambient formatting

Dark mode + theming

Local backup and restore

Public launch on Azure + GitHub Issues for feedback
